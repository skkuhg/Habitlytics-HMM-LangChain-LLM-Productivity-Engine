# HMM-LangChain-Analytics

A productivity analytics project leveraging Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and LangChain for intelligent habit tracking and productivity analysis using Large Language Models (LLM).

## Overview

This project combines traditional statistical modeling with modern LLM capabilities to analyze productivity patterns and habits. It uses HMM for modeling behavioral states and LangChain for integrating language model capabilities into the analysis pipeline.

## Features

- **Habit Tracking Analysis**: Analyze productivity patterns from time-series data
- **HMM State Modeling**: Model different productivity states using Hidden Markov Models
- **LangChain Integration**: Leverage LLMs for intelligent insights and reporting
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate comprehensive productivity reports with visualizations
