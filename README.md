# 🎯 Habitlytics HMM Productivity Engine

*An intelligent habit and productivity state analyzer powered by Hidden Markov Models, LangChain, and Large Language Models*

## 🚀 Overview

**Habitlytics HMM Productivity Engine** is a cutting-edge productivity analytics platform that revolutionizes how we understand and optimize personal productivity patterns. By combining the mathematical rigor of Hidden Markov Models with the contextual intelligence of Large Language Models through LangChain, this system provides unprecedented insights into your productivity states and behavioral patterns.

### 🧠 Core Innovation

The system treats productivity as a series of hidden states that can be inferred from observable behaviors. Using HMM, we model the probabilistic transitions between different productivity states (Deep Work, Distracted, Break, Flow State, etc.), while LangChain integration enables natural language interpretation of these patterns and generation of actionable insights.

## ✨ Key Features
